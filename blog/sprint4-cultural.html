        <h2 class='sprintFourCulturalHTwo'>What is Neuroplasticity?</h2>

        <p class='textDump'>Neuroplasticity is the science of the brain adapting to changes and new information over time. The name comes from the idea that our brains are 'plastic' mouldable objects, that can grow and create new pathways for holding information.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>It's beneficial to know, because it proves that no person cannot learn something they want to. The science behind it is that as you try and learn new information; that you may feel is out of your realm of expertise and completely above you; is in fact within grasp of you being able to learn it.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>It proves that because a person may not be great with maths, they still have an equal opportunity to become great at it. Improvement over time builds new pathways to retain new information, which get stronger and larger as you work on it.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>Basically, the brain is in fact a muscle - and how you work that muscle out is entirely up to you - but it's extremely important to know that you CAN in fact learn whatever you set out to. Dedication and training is key to growth - this all builds on your neuroplasticity, as it moulds and adapts.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>If you want to know more, I highly recommend having a read through of this link: <a href='https://www.emotiv.com/glossary/neuroplasticity/#:~:text=Neuroplasticity%20is%20the%20ability%20of,new%20neural%20connections%20over%20time.&text=Neuroplasticity%20explains%20how%20the%20human,after%20a%20traumatic%20brain%20injury.'>Neuroplasticity</a> </p>

        <h2 class='sprintFourCulturalHTwo'>What is the Growth Mindset?</h2>

        <p class='textDump'>The growth mindset, is different to neuroplasticity in the sense that it's more of an emotional and environmental trait. It's still about you - but maybe not as much of a scientific form.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>The Growth Mindset is relevant because it's a sympathetic, helpful trait to have or understand. The idea behind the growth mindset is that essentially you put a positive spin on actions of yourself and those around you.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>For example, look at a grading system. Whether that's in school, high school, university etc. You've got a threshold for all testing, and it's usually a pass/fail system at it's core.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>This word 'fail', has such a negative connotation and effect on people. It doesn't make you feel good - in fact, in every case would make you feel worse.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>In the growth mindset though, if you were to replace the word 'fail' with a 'not yet' for example; this makes the student or person - not feel like they gave it their all and they didn't get the result they were after. It implies that with more practice, more study, more time - that it's something that's still achievable. The example of using the word 'not yet' has been tested in schools, and the outcome for the students always ends up higher than the original pass/fail lingo.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>I think if everyone adopts this mindset, it not only helps you be more sympathetic and relateable - it also makes you more supportive for those around you and yourself.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>Going down the rabbit hole of looking into a growth mindset has been a real eye opener to how we can systematically target things in our community, and provide a more supportive and open platform for everyone - and I for one, will be opting for this in the future.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>You can watch a really great TED talk on it here: <a href='https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099'>The Growth Mindset</a></p>
