          <div class='cardContainer'>
          <div class='textCard cardLeft'>
            <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>

            <p class='cardStory'>I had a bit of an ethical decision to make around the time of the COVID lockdown here in NZ.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>I was working in the events industry, as a vision specialist and production manager. There were a lot of job cuts, reduced hours and overall it was a pretty bad time for the company - as it was for most.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>Working on other projects within the industry, was always seen as very taboo. I was approached to work on an external project that would have been a great use of my skillset.. Plus it was my ticket to recoup some losses and plan for a career change.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>I really had to weigh up whether or not this was a boat worth rocking, and I decided to approach it with caution and layed out the terms with both parties with a little bit of built in flexibility so that the commitments never crossed paths.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>The consequences of this, was that I was extremely busy. I found that I had gone from working 30ish hours a week on reduced hours, to 50-70 hours between the two projects for a few months.</p>
          </div>

          <div class='textCard cardRight'>
            <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>

            <p class='cardStory'>Well, my culture growing up was based around a family that worked a lot.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>It's definitely come out in me, one of my worst personal traits that can be taken as one of my best career traits.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>Work comes first a lot for me, and I build my personal life around that - it was a real eye opener going into COVID lockdowns as I went from working 1.5x the average persons hours each week, to just.. nothing, really.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>Something to work on in the now; and the future!</p>
          </div>

          <div class='textCard cardLeft'>
            <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>

            <p class='cardStory'>One of my notable qualities that I'd consider both a strength and limitation; if i had to put it down to a work it would be determination.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>It's a double whammy, I can be so dedicated to completing a task that I lose track of the over all picture.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>I'd see this as helping me push through a task. At the same time; if I ran into an issue, I don't let it go.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>Sometimes, you need to know when to let it go; and reach out for help instead of banging your head against the issue at hand.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>You've got to learn when your attitude gets in the way of your development, and your team is always there to be a team.</p>
          </div>

          <div class='textCard cardRight'>
            <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>

            <p class='cardStory'>Well, I covered this in the previous evaluation, but I can't stress it enough (hopefully, it'll help it sink in for me!)</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>I think it will really aid in trying to gather so much learning in a comparatively short amount of time to the traditional path.</p>

          </div>

          <div class='textCard cardLeft'>
            <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2>

            <p class='cardStory'>The side project I took on mentioned above, I was working in a Head of Department role across the project.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>It actually involved working with a lot of staff members who previously worked under me at the Business I was full time at - I'd actually rate my team as some very good friends.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>Sometimes, given the scale of things and the pace of the work at hand - different people end up with different ideas on how something may technically function.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>We had a particular electrical issue, given it was outdoors - just a little bit of water got into a multicore power cable.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>There was a bit of back and forth, a debate if you will; on why we were having this particular issue with this particular circuit and what needed to be done to resolve it.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>I knew exactly what it was, but after a bit of a debate - the consesus from another member was that it was for other reasons. I saw it as a learning opportunity for everyones development; if I was wrong, I would have learned something and vice versa.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>I think it was a real leadership decision, I know a lot of senior members that would push their seniority over another member.</p>

            <p class='cardStory'>In this particular instance, I think it was the best way to tackle the issue and I wouldn't change the strategy; even thinking back on it.</p>
