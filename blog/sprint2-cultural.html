    <div class='textCard cardLeft'>
      <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>

      <p class='cardStory'>My long term career goal, would be to eventually find a job that I both thoroughly enjoy; and
        is semi flexible.</p>

      <p class='cardStory'>My current goal is to learn to become a competent programmer; to have the skills to learn new
        languages in hopes that I can move into the software/game dev field.</p>

      <p class='cardStory'>I've always loved logical, thorough thinking and problem solving. Without those things, I
        lose interest - with programming; I'm pretty sure those two things will never cease to be required!</p>
    </div>

    <div class='textCard cardRight'>
      <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>

      <p class='cardStory'>Social skills - I feel like I've incurred some form of social debt from working so much in my
        past</p>

      <p class='cardStory'>Socially, I feel like I could really grow to be more comfortable in things outside of work
        related topics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class='textCard cardLeft'>
      <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>

      <p class='cardStory'>One of my notable qualities that I'd consider both a strength and limitation; if i had to put
        it down to a work it would be determination.</p>

      <p class='cardStory'>It's a double whammy, I can be so dedicated to completing a task that I lose track of the
        over all picture.</p>

      <p class='cardStory'>I'd see this as helping me push through a task. At the same time; if I ran into an issue, I
        don't let it go.</p>

      <p class='cardStory'>Sometimes, you need to know when to let it go; and reach out for help instead of banging your
        head against the issue at hand.</p>

      <p class='cardStory'>You've got to learn when your attitude gets in the way of your development, and your team is
        always there to be a team.</p>
    </div>

    <div class='textCard cardRight'>
      <h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
        should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other
        learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h2>

      <p class='cardStory'>I think me commiting and sticking to projects and tasks isn't going to be an issue with
        workloads, based on the self and external assessment of qualities.</p>

      <p class='cardStory'>One thing I'll be committing to heavily doing, is really engaging in group activities with
        courtesy, support and understanding that people move at different paces.</p>

      <p class='cardStory'>Everyone will need help and support at times, even me, and I think as a cohort we just need
        to support each other.</p>

    </div>

    <div class='textCard cardLeft'>
      <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>

      <p class='cardStory'>I do like a bit of solo problem solving, but dependant on the task - I'm going to try and
        bring an issue to light with my cohort when I need it.</p>

      <p class='cardStory'>This not only helps me, and aids my growth but also shows that we're all in this together and
        hopefully; others follow suit and it becomes a really friendly, and supportive environment not only with the
        facilitators; but amongst each other in the cohort.</p>


    </div>

    <div class='textCard cardRight'>
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>

      <p class='cardStory'>I hadn't really thought about it, but if i had to sum it up; I'd put it down to guidance.</p>

      <p class='cardStory'>It's great to have a facilitation team to help us out, help us dive deeper into problems, and
        also to check in with individuals and help guide us all in the right direction if we need it.</p>

    </div>

    <div class='textCard cardLeft'>
      <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you
        might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h2>

      <p class='cardStory'>Nothing as far I know at this stage - I'm doing bits and pieces of work throughout the
        foundations period but I've managed to keep myself open for bootcamp to ensure I get the most out of the
        experience.</p>
