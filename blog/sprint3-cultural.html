          <h1 class='sprintThreeHeader'>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>

          <img id='mindfullImage' src="../images/mindfulness.jpg" alt="">

          <p class='textDump'>Emotional intelligence reflects on your ability to manage, understand and use your own emotions in ways that will benefit you. It’s the core understanding of yourself, the feelings you feel; and the feelings of those around you.</p>

            <p  class='textDump'>rates you on your intelligence, your ability to solve complex issues, your ability to take in information and really put it to use. Emotional intelligence can work the same, but instead of it being a mathematical issue with big numbers, or looking at a complex technical diagram and pinpointing where an issue is - it’s problem solving for your body, mind, and emotions.</p>
            
            <p  class='textDump'>Most people generally break emotional intelligence down into four attributes, these are:</p>
            <ul  class='textDump'>
                <li  class='sThreeLists'>Self-management</li> 
                <li  class='sThreeLists'>Self-Awareness</li>
                <li  class='sThreeLists'>Social-Awareness</li>
                <li  class='sThreeLists'>Relationship-management</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p  class='textDump'>I’ve known some extremely intelligent people who were completely intolerable. Their EQ (emotional intelligence) had almost been handicapped on their quest for knowledge and understanding of all the issues around them - at a technical level.</p>
            
            <p  class='textDump'>What they weren’t working on, was their emotional intelligence; emotional intelligence aids things like mindfulness, helps you manage your stress and emotions, helps you build better relationships and become more self aware of the life changes around you.</p>
            
            <p  class='textDump'>The questions you ask yourself as a person, can really help develop these skills. If you’re having a bad day, feeling stressed out, feeling angry at a friend, family member or colleague, some of the things you can ask yourself are:</p>
            
            <ul  class='textDump'>
                <li class='sThreeLists'>What are your emotions telling you?</li> 
                <li class='sThreeLists'>Why are your emotions telling you that? Is it the problem at hand? What other things do you have/had happening to you that could contribute to this?
                </li>
                <li class='sThreeLists'> How can I handle this better? </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p  class='textDump'>Asking yourself some of these questions in times of stress, and angst can really help you reflect on why you’re at the place you are now. It puts you in a state of mindfulness and awareness - which can really change your perspective on things.</p>
            
            <p  class='textDump'>You might reflect on what you’re feeling and why, and decide that it’s not as bad as you initially thought. Alternatively, you could reflect on the issue at hand and you deem you’re justified in the way you feel and that it is a big deal - the important thing here is that you reflected, you learned, you grew from experience.</p>
            
            <p  class='textDump'>Some people are born into environments where their emotional intelligence can flourish, some aren’t - and that’s ok. Emotional intelligence like any other skill can be built upon; nobody is outright emotionally inept, and unable to grow on an emotional level. It just takes time, practice, and reflection.</p>
            
            <p class='textDump'>These changes aren’t entirely just socially and internally for the mind. Things that have an adverse effect on your health such as a big one like stress; can be better managed through developing on your EQ. Stress has several different physical detrimental effects as well as mental. Ask yourself some of the example questions above.</p> 
            
            <p class='textDump'>Through reflection, assessment, and just taking a moment out of your day to realise ‘What is going on in my life at the moment’ and ‘Why does this make me feel the way I do’ can help you better identify some of the patterns in your life that lead to these events and moments. They can help your mind stay on track, stay focused, and stay mindful.</p>
