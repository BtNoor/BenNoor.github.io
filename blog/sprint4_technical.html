        <img id='tangleImage' src="../images/tangle.png" alt="">

        <h2 class='sprintFourTechnicalHTwo'>When was a time you got blocked on a simple problem?</h2>

        <p class='textDump'>A time where this happened, was just two days ago actually. During the Kata challenges we
            were given - one of the tasks was to take some information, and add them to an object.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>Now, for those who don't know - objects are similar to arrays in the fact they're a thing;
            with bits of segregated information. However, adding things to objects versus arrays is totally differnt.
            With the Array type, you can just push information to it and it'll tack that piece you've sent to it on the
            end of it.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>Objects though.. Objects you basically just tell it that this new piece of information is
            going to be a thing. You tell it what the things value is. No pushing, no giving it a particular spot, just
            tell it that it exists.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>I went around and around in circles, trying to explain my situation to myself, trying to
            google the different types of ways to interact with this thing but it was all unfamiliar, I felt really
            frustrated.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>So, I took a break. After going around and around for hours; I took a step back, did
            something else for a while. Hell, I event slept on it!</p>

        <p class='textDump'>What this did, was left me feeling refreshed and ambitious that I was going to nail it the
            following morning, nothing could stop me from solving this problem! Truth be told, I sat down in front of my
            monitor in the morning, fresh coffee in hand, read over my problem, had an idea, tried the idea thinking
            'This is it!'</p>

        <p class='textDump'>Test Failed. Hmm...</p>

        <p class='textDump'>I went straight back to feeling how I had the previous night, when I just couldn't solve it
            - frustrated, stressed, impulsive to try anything.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>After I'd collected myself, I realised this wasn't the way. I was going to have to employ
            another technique and approach to tackling this problem. There had to be a better way.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>So I tried pseudocode, which is the process of writing out each step in just normal text so
            that you understood and could refer back to it when you were trying to program.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>Then I did a bit of googling to see how others had tackled a similar problem.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>THEN, and this was probably the most important step for my programming. At each step of the
            way, I would check the outcome to determine whether or not my expected result, was in fact what I was
            receiving.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>Although this felt like it took a long time, debugging a simple thing, step by step, line by
            line, ultimately - it took less time. It really helped deconstruct what was happening, and where my problems
            were - just taking a moment and checking things over thoroughly.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>What I learnt was to really try and slow things down in a problem, really try and understand
            what is happening. I don't mean that in the sense of 'I had a problem, I'm going to do all these things in
            quick succession to solve my issue as quickly as possble'. I mean, that's great in a live environment sense,
            maybe. Probably not.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>I took a break, I did other things, I analyzed my issues with a fresh mind, and came up with
            a way to work towards fixing it as opposed to getting stuck in the moment going around and around and around
            trying different combinations of the same thing.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>So next time, really take a moment out. Think about what that means for you, everyones
            process will be different. Slow things down as much as you can; and try and come out the other side wiser,
            more pragmatic, and calmer.</p>

        <h2 class='sprintFourTechnicalHTwo'>What about a time where you solved a problem in an elegant way?</h2>

        <p class='textDump'>In the katas we were given, one was the classic FizzBuzz challenge.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>Basically, the program would be fed a particular number, or multiple numbers. If it was
            divisible by 3, it would change the number to Fizz, if it was divisible by 5, it would change the number to
            Buzz, and multiples of both would be replaced with FizzBuzz.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>I felt I did particularly well on this one, given the time allocation given to do it in.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>Straight out of the gate, my approach was different. I was working with something familiar,
            raw simple maths. On one hand, i'd heard about this simple thing tripping even CS grads up; and leading into
            it I was a little nervous if I'm honest.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>I analyzed the problem at hand, I didn't write pseudocode but I did pseudocode in my head. I
            thought about the outcomes of different operators, thinking about division, thinking about what different
            methods would return, thinking about what I'd have to do next.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>I took a couple of minutes to just think about what needed to happen, did a search to see
            what operators I had at my disposal, picked the best case, and thought about what each operator could do for
            me.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>After analyzing the facts and the data, I wen't in with a clear head and a plan. The first
            half took me next to no time, I felt great! Writing a function and having it pass all the tests in one go;
            really gave me a boost of confidence.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>Thinking back on it, if I had dove head first into writing some code and hoping for the best
            - the outcome would have been different. I would have ended up in the same position as I had above, just
            going around and around in circles without a clear goal.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>Even after all the tests returned a passed result, I still went back and logged everything
            to the console at each step, to ensure that what I had planned; was what was happening.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>It really showed me how valuable taking a moment and analyzing a problem at hand, and just
            thinking - not doing - could be really valuable in the future.</p>

        <p class='textDump'>I feel like through a bit of thought and planning, I turned what could be an irritating
            problem; into a really enjoyable experience.</p>
